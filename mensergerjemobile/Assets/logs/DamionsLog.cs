    /// Scripts created:
    /// + GameUI.cs
    /// + PlayerTurn.cs
    /// 
    /// Scripts edited:
    /// > CameraBehaviour.cs -> zooming limited, working on camera rotation and added debug controls for pc
    /// > BeardCone.cs -> entire script created, apparently touch and mousebutton 0 are the same
    /// 
    /// Built several tests for camera rotation -> Finally working
    /// Built a few tests for cone movement -> Successful and optimized
    /// Cones are now placed on invisible planes, which you can move around by dragging them
    /// Turn system is up and running
    /// UI has a panel showing the current player's turn and a button to move to the next turn
    /// Build first test for turn system -> Buttons might be bigger
    /// 
    /// To Do List:
    /// - Make the camera rotate around the board on mobile version
    /// - A main menu -> Daan is working on this
    /// - Option to choose an amount of players
    /// - Grid snapping
    /// - Cone kicking
    /// - Dice rolling
    /// 
    /// Next Update Log will be rolling out ASAP.
